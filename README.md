This project represents the creation of graph and other operation that can be done on it, such as add/remove vertex, check if it is a "connected graph", Finding the shortest path between two vertices and more.

- Node- A class represents a vertex in the graph defined by an id and has set of operations applicable on a vertex.

- Edge- A class represents an edge in the graph defined by Source and destination vertices and has set of operations applicable on a directional edge(src,dest) in a (directional) weighted graph. 

- Dgraph- A class represents a directional weighted graph.
It has two data structure from type of hash map that represents the vertices and the edges. This class has all the operations to create and change a graph.

- Graph_Algo- A class represents the "regular" Graph Theory algorithms that can be done on a variable graph.

- Window- A class represents the graphical user interface.
